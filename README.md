Hi there! 👋
I'm Jeet Shah
🎯 Data Analyst | Aspiring Data Engineer | Tech Explorer
I’m a data-driven analyst and M.S. Information Technology student at Arizona State University, passionate about turning complex data into clear, actionable insights.
With experience in Python, SQL, and Business Intelligence tools, I love designing data pipelines, crafting insightful dashboards, and building ML-powered solutions that solve real-world problems.
At Vaibhav Laxmi Spinning Mills, I engineered ETL workflows, automated reporting pipelines, and deployed forecasting models that improved operational efficiency. My academic and project work also spans machine learning, cloud data engineering, and NLP applications.
I’m currently seeking full-time opportunities starting January 2026 in Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, or Software Engineering, where I can leverage my technical and analytical skills to drive data-informed decision-making.
